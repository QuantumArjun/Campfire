She glared at the thick bracelet on her bicep. Why did her parents make such a big deal about never taking off? It was heavy and not even stylish. She found clasp and fiddled with it for a moment.

"He extended his hand to her and said, ""Hi, I'm Finkel Wolfson."" She looked at his outstretched hand as if it was crawling with spiders and roaches. ""Oh, I've heard about you,"" she said with a sniff. Finkel panicked. He was 3000 miles away from home; how could she have heard about him?"
"""One of us has to try it,"" Amir said as he pointed to the lumpy, unfamiliar fruit on the tree in front of them. If we don't, we'll starve to death. Death by poison seems worth the risk in case it's edible, doesn't it?"""

"By the time Johnny got home, thousands of sheets of paper had piled up on the floor beside the printer, each with only one sentence printed in bold type: ""I am coming for you, and there's nothing you can do."""
"""How could you have married him? You promised you'd wait for me."""
"""I've lost him,"" she screamed, but none of us knew what she'd lost."
"For a moment, time slowed, and the sound of the approaching storm was all that we could hear."
"""Look out!"" he shouted."
"I'd never last long in the slammer. I get all frantic when I'm in tight spaces, start tryin' to climb the walls and such."

"He watched her leave, knowing that she only locked the flimsy doorknob behind her. He had at least two hours before she'd be back home."
"""Where am I?"""
"""What happened to you?"" She asked."
"There are three things you never mess with if you know what's good for you: heroin, border patrol, and the Valdez cartel."

"""We're sending you to live with another family. It's for your own safety."""
"As she watched this hulking, hairy animal lope across her backyard, she wondered what two creatures collaborated to make this tremendous beast, and what was it looking for?"
"""She hasn't spoken a word since the accident. Our friend said that you might be able to help her."""
"""Don't lie to me. I already know the truth."""
"As he walked away, his smile grew from a smirk to an all-out grin."
"""Why is all of Daddy's stuff in the front yard?"""
He counted his register drawer again. How could he be short $2500?
"The teacher looked at his gaping shoes and tattered clothes and knew she had to find out what was really going on at home or this kid would end up in the system. She called him up to her desk and asked, ""Do you want to help me on a project this weekend?"""
"If he hurried, he might be able to get back to work before anyone found out what he had done."
"""Do you have experience with demons?"" she whispered from under the table."
"""This medicine numbs the pain, but it will also permanently numb your ability to feel pleasure. Do you want it?"""

"When she walked outside the next morning, she realized his curse must have worked."

He was inside the video game! But wait—if he was in here... who had the controls?
"She bent down to pick up the strange-looking shell from the sand, but as soon as her hand touched it, the earth started to shake."
He opened the letter and sunk to his knees in the middle of the driveway.
"""What are we going to do once the last of this food is gone?"" he asked."
She looked closer and realized that this tree was growing dollar bills instead of leaves and quarters instead of acorns.
"There is never a better time to say ""I'm sorry"" than when karma is kicking you good."
"When the pigeon swooped down in front of her, she realized it had a note attached to its right leg."
"""I'll need to speak to at least three of your ex-girlfriends to check your references before I'll go on a date with you."""
"""Mommy, there's a ghost in my room!"""
Something wasn't right. No one seemed to recognize her. No one even really seemed to see her. Could he have erased her existence?
"They had never been this high before. As she reached for the next rock outcropping, she wondered if it was actually close enough to reach, or if she was about to fall into the canyon."
"""This is something we don't usually show visitors,"" the museum docent whispered as she unlocked the door marked ""DANGER!"""
"He looked both ways before crossing the street, not realizing that he had just made the worst decision of his life."
"""How did you get that scar?"""
He muttered a few extra spells as he stirred the potion. He couldn't risk it malfunctioning this time.
"Every person on the street and in the mall looked identical. They were all wearing red shirts and blue shorts, and every single one was a man with light skin and short brown hair. What had happened, and how was she the only one who was still different?"
"""You don't understand,"" she said, looking at him sadly. ""I am not who you think I am."""
All the lights in the city went out and they knew the monsters were surrounding them.
"""If you take one step closer, it'll be the last step you ever take,"" he said, pointing the weapon at the strange figure in front of him. But his threat was useless, since the creature had no feet."
"There, nestled within the grove of trees, was the thing he'd been waiting for since he was 12 years old."
"""Who's there?"" Her words bounced off of the metal walls of shipping containers when she awoke. But there was only the echo of her own voice to answer her."
"They were lost in the woods and they knew it, although this time was different. This time, they were hunted."
Looking into the fire was the wrong thing to do. He found he couldn't drag his stare away.
It wasn't until my father pushed me off the cliff that I believed he was telling the truth.
The sign hit them like an inanimate object.
"The pumpkin would not stop growing, despite the application of the second potion. The witch had lied."

"They think they know me, but they don't really. I hunt only at night and only when I know I have the advantage over my prey."
City slicker like myself doesn't have a wit of business in the country. They knew it. I knew it. Not a one of us in that room was happy I'd purchased the land.
"Here's the thing about family. Family sticks together, but it's almost never roses and sunshine. Family sticks together when you have nothing; so when you have it all, well, things get complicated in a different way."
